# Cisco-Packet-Tracer-Internetwork-Lab
Building a 6-network enterprise topology from scratch using Cisco Packet Tracer. Learning routing, switching, and server services.

Internetwork Project

Project Status: 🚧 Under Construction (Sprint 0)

About This Project
Welcome to my Project-Based Learning (PBL) journey! I am building a complete, multi-router internetwork simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer. 

Instead of just memorizing commands, I am treating this network like a "Smart City"(which is my way of learning via PBL:
Routers= The Traffic Control/Police (Directing data traffic)
Switches= The Neighborhood Hubs (Connecting local devices)
Cables= The Roads (Where data travels)
Servers= The Downtown Business District (Web & DNS)

My goal is to configure a fully functional enterprise network with dynamic routing (RIPv2), DHCP, and DNS services from scratch.

Tech Stack
Simulator: Cisco Packet Tracer
Hardware Emulated: Cisco 2621XM Routers, 2960 Switches
Protocols: RIPv2, HTTP, DNS, DHCP, ICMP

The Agile Sprint Plan
I am building this in phases (Sprints) to ensure deep understanding:

Sprint 0: Planning & Setup(Current Phase) - Designing the topology and IP scheme.
Sprint 1: Physical Layer- Placing devices and cabling the "roads".
Sprint 2: Basic Config- Hostnames, passwords, and "waking up" the interfaces.
Sprint 3: The Highway System - Configuring RIPv2 dynamic routing.
Sprint 4: Services District - Setting up Web (HTTP) and Phonebook (DNS) servers.
Sprint 5: Documentation- Final testing and portfolio showcase.

Snapshots
(I will upload screenshots of my progress here as I build the city!)*
